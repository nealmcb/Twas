        "description": "Thank you for visiting The Wild Animal Sanctuary. A written transcript of the audio tour can be found by scanning the QR codes on each of the audio boxes. The Wild Animal Sanctuary began rescuing animals in January 1980 and is the oldest and largest sanctuary in the world dedicated to rescuing captive-born large carnivores. Here at the main Keenesburg location, there are over 500 rescued animals, and the sanctuary encompasses over 1,200 acres stretching 2 miles north to south, and here where you stand, it is 1.25 miles wide\u2014east to west. If you look to the east, or to the left, along the horizon line there are a number of 15 to 20 acre habitats. With its large-acreage habitats, the Sanctuary provides an unparalleled home for large carnivores, with about 200 Bears living here as well as about 150 Lions and Tigers along with many other species of animals.",

        "description": "The Wild Animal Sanctuary has an absolutely unique way to view its rescued animals. Our number one goal is to give the animals the best home possible, so it is imperative that the presence of people does not disturb them. The solution is our Mile Into the Wild walkway that averages 20 to 40 feet in height above the ground. Just as human beings are not concerned about birds and airplanes above them, the animals do not consider the sky above them as territory they need to be concerned with. Therefore, the tens of thousands of visitors each year presents no threat to the animals and their territory, and they are able to go about their lives in a carefree manner. The 1.51 miles of elevated walkway has been certified by Guinness World Records as the longest pedestrian footbridge in the world. The walkway is built on-site and more information about that construction can be found farther down the walkway.",

This building is used to house fire-fighting equipment and other essential supplies for our Animal Care and Operations teams. Directly beyond it are multiple Lion habitats, in which lions rescued from Spain and Bolivia live. In another one of the Lion habitats is where Baby Leo and his pride of Lions live. Baby Leo was rescued at four months of age after unsuccessfully being given to a three year old girl as a birthday present! Also out in that direction is the Asiatic Black Bear, Dillan, rescued from a sportsmen\u2019s club in Pennsylvania in early 2020. Even farther out and to the south are over a dozen Tiger habitats in which live most of the 39 Tigers rescued from the self-proclaimed \u201cTiger King\u201d, Joe Exotic, in late 2017.",

        "description": "In front of you in the middle of our Leopard habitat is what we call our Leopard sky bridge. Like most cats, including house cats, Leopards enjoy being in a position that is higher than the ground around them. This gives them an obvious sense of safety but also allows them to better see the surrounding terrain. If you look closely at the four towers holding up the bridge, you will see that there are four platforms. The Leopards, especially in the evening hours, can often be found on one of those higher platforms. The Sanctuary has both typical orange-spotted Leopards as well as melanistic or black Leopards. In the wild only about 4 to 6% of these powerful animals are melanistic but they are more common in captivity. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved.

        "description": "In front of you are three smaller enclosures almost identical in appearance with each having a concrete shelter as well as a concrete pipe that leads to an underground den. Such lockouts are essential for every animal the Sanctuary rescues. An animal that has been in a small cage its entire life cannot immediately be released into a larger area, as they would feel overwhelmed, insecure and terrified. The lockouts also aid in the introduction of a new animal to established animal populations, similar to someone perhaps having a new cat being introduced to other cats in the household. New cats may spend time in a bathroom or laundry room with the door closed to allow a more gradual introduction. The same is true for animals rescued here at the Sanctuary.",

        "title": "Underground Dens",
        "description": "Another feature in every habitat that is essential for the safety, well-being, and protection of the animals are the underground or above-ground dens. As you can see, there is a concrete pipe that leads down into the ground. It actually goes back about 20 feet to an underground buried concrete bunker that is about 6-feet tall, 6-feet wide and 12-feet long. Because it is buried underground it stays at a very stable temperature of approximately 60-degrees Fahrenheit or 15-degrees Celsius year-round. Most of the animals at the Sanctuary use their dens more in the summer to get out of the heat than they do the winter to get out of the cold. Of course, the Bears use their dens for hibernation each winter. Even though they may not be visible to guests, there are underground dens in every habitat, so that throughout the Sanctuary there are literally hundreds of dens for the animals. Dens provide a much more stable protective environment than trees do and are a great asset to our animals.",

        "description": "One of the most common questions we get from guests is how do the animals do in the winter time? This is a natural question since most people associate Lions with the warm savannas of Africa or Tigers with the hot jungles of India. However, keep in mind that none of these animals have ever lived in their natural wild habitat. The short answer is the animals do great in cool and cold weather, and in most cases, they prefer it to the heat of the summer. Animals are typically much more visible in the cool and winter months than they are during the heat of summer. Fortunately, Mother Nature is very adaptable and if the animals are here as the seasons change, their coats naturally grow thicker as the temperatures drop-- just like it does with livestock or indigenous animals that live in variable climates.",

        "title": "Solitary vs. Social Animals",
        "description": "One of the things that makes The Wild Animal Sanctuary unique is that the vast majority of animals live in social groups consisting of multiple animals. Naturally, the thought of having a pride of Lions or pack of Wolves makes perfect sense, since they live in larger social groups in the wild. But what about the Sanctuary\u2019s habitats that are full of Bears or Tigers or Leopards? Aren\u2019t these animals normally more solitary in nature? Well, yes, they are, but that is typically out of necessity based on the prey animals they hunt, and how they go about their hunting. For example, Lions have evolved to prey on larger, abundant herd animals and their manner of hunting is much more successful when it is accomplished as a group or pride. The same is true of Wolves who also hunt larger herd animals. But when prey animals are less numerous or spread out over a wider area, many species of predators rely on stealth and ambush to catch their prey, and thus do better hunting and living in a more solitary manner. Here at the Sanctuary the animals are provided with ample amounts of food that requires no hunting, which then negates the need for such specialized hunting and survival tactics. On top of that, once the competition over mating rights and territory are also removed, even normally-solitary animals gravitate towards living a more social life with others of their own kind. None of the animals at the Sanctuary are allowed to reproduce since that would only be adding to the problem of captive born wildlife and use up valuable resources. Preventing reproduction is accomplished by neutering all of the male animals except for African Lions. Male Lions are not neutered since it would cause the loss of their manes which play an important role in pride dynamics and the psychology of the Lion himself. Instead, the Lionesses receive a contraceptive implant which suppresses their estrus cycle, thus reducing the competition for mating rights almost to zero. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

        "description": "Directly below you is one of our large Fox habitats. Within this habitat are multiple Foxes that may make you work to find them. Most are Red Foxes with various color variations that were rescued from a now-closed Iowa facility that specialized in the breeding of Foxes for fur and fashion. Each animal spent their life in small, elevated cages made of wire on all sides \u2013 even under their paws! After a brief acclimation period here, they were soon enamored with their massive new home. Throughout your visit today, be sure to check directly below you, especially in the warmer times of year when the walkway provides shade. Additionally, the Foxes can be found curled up in the shady tall grass in the summer months. However, just as often, they might be laying out in the open\u2014especially when it's cooler out.",

        "description": "Keep in mind throughout your visit today that you will have to work a little bit to see animals. Yes, some may be quite visible and out in the open, but that is not always the case. Our experience has shown that the enjoyment of one\u2019s visit is directly proportional to how much work they put into looking for animals. At the Sanctuary, we never force our animals to be on display so they may choose to be visible or not. Be sure to look both directly underneath the walkway where it is shady, but also out in the distance-- allowing your eyes to focus on objects farther away. It is also helpful to keep looking ahead of you and behind you because animals do move about, and an animal you missed a few minutes ago may now be within eyesight. To the west, or towards the mountains, you\u2019ll see a large jungle-gym type structure. This is a part of the Sanctuary\u2019s Jaguar habitat. Currently thriving within are two Jaguars, Manchas and Bagheera. Like Leopards, Jaguars are relatively rare in captivity, so we\u2019ve never had a large number of them. Manchas began life as a so-called family pet in Mexico. The family quickly realized that they made a poor choice and, fortunately, he found his way to a rescue organization we work with in Mexico. The female Black Jaguar, Bagheera, also came to that same facility after found abandoned at an airport in Mexico and time spent at a horrible facility where she suffered greatly. They\u2019re often seen patrolling the territory, climbing the platforms, or simply playing with one another, now completely free of all the troubles of their pasts.",

        "description": "Looking farther west behind Manchas, the Jaguar, there is a very large habitat with a pride of African Lions. This pride was rescued in 2023 from Puerto Rico\u2019s only zoo in the city of Mayag\u00fcez. Damage from hurricanes, along with numerous other financial and animal welfare issues, resulted in the zoo\u2019s closure in 2017 \u2013 and the subsequent lack of care each animal tragically suffered since. After years of countless animal deaths with no end in sight, the United States Department of Justice intervened and asked The Wild Animal Sanctuary to organize the placement and transportation for the entire zoo\u2019s 700+ remaining animals! Months of hard work, combined with the kindness & generosity of our supporters, made this unprecedented, historic rescue a roaring success. TWAS found new forever homes for each animal across the nation \u2013 ranging from tarantula to elephant. These majestic lions are now relishing their large-acreage habitat where they regularly interact with neighboring Lion prides. The desolate, concrete confinement of their pasts is a distant memory. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved. Terms of Use | Privacy Policy",

Pearl, the white female, and Brutus, the orange-colored male can sometimes be tricky to find when they lay down in the grass. A head may pop up you didn\u2019t know was there! These Tigers spent time at Joe Exotic\u2019s Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park that was featured in the Netflix docuseries, \u201cTiger King\u201d after being bred for a \u201cswimming with tigers\u201d venture in Florida. Online video footage shows terrified cubs flailing in the water with patrons seemingly enjoying the experience. The cubs were subject to exhaustion and hypothermia, and like with all small cub encounters, were separated from their mother at birth or shortly thereafter. We hope you enjoy seeing these Tigers living freely, and not being exploited for financial gain. Just up ahead on the left side of the walkway is another habitat with Coyotes. Even if not down in their dens, they can still be difficult to see, even in plain sight, due to the color of their fur. These Coyotes came from a terrible zoo situation in Mexico where they were living in small transfer cages stacked on top of one another because the zoo had no other room for them. In this enclosure you will notice a cantilevered overhang at the top of the fence which is one way to prevent animals from climbing over the fence. Another thing you will notice with the Fox, Coyote and Wolf habitats is that it is necessary to have either rocks or concrete underneath the fence to prevent digging. It is not that the animals are trying to escape, but as many guests can attest to, canines simply love to dig. If you are here in the late hours of the day, the Sanctuary\u2019s Coyotes and perhaps even some wild Coyote residents may serenade you with their yipping and howling, which is always an enjoyable experience.",

        "description": "In the long narrow habitat behind the Coyotes you will find a number of Black Bears. In each case they come from very horrible situations. Most of the Bears were rescued from South Carolina where they were used for the ancient blood sport of Bear-baiting. South Carolina was the last state in the country to make this illegal. Bear-baiting is where the Bears would be chained to a wall and then hunting dogs could practice assailing them. In order to protect the dogs, the Bears were both declawed and had their canine teeth filed down or removed. Another Black Bear in this habitat is one of our most well-known animals. Her name is Ricki and she was rescued from a tourist place in Pennsylvania where people could buy ice cream and play miniature golf. She lived in a small concrete enclosure for close to 20 years. But fortunately, there was eventually enough public pressure placed on the owner and he agreed to give her up. Now all of these bears can live comfortable lives free of exploitation and abuse. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved. Terms of Use | Privacy Policy",

        "description": "In the habitat you are approaching are five Syrian Brown Bears. The habitat is on both sides of the walkway. These five Bears were rescued from a roadside zoo in Wisconsin that lost its license to possess and exhibit such animals. These Bears were only about 2 \u00bd years old when they arrived, but they have been enjoying life here at the Sanctuary ever since. The two males, Diesel and Chumlee, are particularly close and are rarely very far apart from one another. In the summer months, all of the Bears greatly enjoy their habitat\u2019s water features. Chumlee and Diesel can often be found wrestling with each other in the water and dunking one another. About halfway between here and the entrance to the Lion House on the right side of the walkway you will notice the opening to an underground den that was dug by one of the Bears. It is quite large, and probably goes down about 6 or 7 feet and is about 15 feet in length. The large wooden framed structure is left over from when this area was part of a Lion habitat, where it was used as a shade structure.",

Two of the Bears, along with 17 big cats, came from a now closed notorious roadside zoo in Indiana called \u201cWildlife in Need\u201d in Fall, 2020. Other Grizzly Bears were rescued in early 2021, coming from yet another notorious Bear breeder in Indiana. In late summer, 2022, Jebbie, (orphaned in the Alaskan wilds) joined this habitat after brief stints at two different zoos including the Detroit Zoo, who asked we provide the young bear with a forever home. Now all together, these bears have the freedom to happily roam and play each day as they please.",

Even though such animals are not large carnivores, because the Sanctuary has a fair amount of pastureland, we occasionally take in animals that are simply in dire need of a home or part of a larger rescue. Two female Ostriches were rescued from their life in a parking lot in Santa Fe, New Mexico and four of the Emu came from a dilapidated, rundown place in Wyoming. If you are interested in a very unique item, the eggs laid by the two female Ostriches are sold in the Sanctuary\u2019s Gift Shop. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved.

        "description": "You are now standing in the Bolivia Lion House. The structure was built in late 2010 in anticipation of the Sanctuary rescuing 25 African Lions from the South American country. In 2009 Bolivia passed a national law prohibiting the use of animals in circuses. As a result, hundreds of animals needed homes including 25 African Lions. So as not to break up family groups, the Sanctuary agreed to take all 25 Lions at the same time. Because they were arriving in February 2011, it was necessary to build a building that could be heated since the animals would not be acclimated to the winter weather. The eight sub-enclosures in the Lion House were built to accommodate the Lions who came from eight different circuses. In the ensuing months, as the Lions adapted to their new home and climate, they were introduced into the four surrounding and other habitats. This rescue created quite a stir in the local area as it received a lot of media coverage. After all, how often does a large cargo plane land in Denver with 25 African Lions?! It remains to this day one of the premier rescues undertaken by the Sanctuary.",

That\u2019s because there are a large number of Lions prides living in close proximity to one another. This, of course, is very beneficial to Lions since they are such social and territorial creatures and derive immense amounts of enrichment through interacting with other Lions. In addition to the Lions that live here at the Lion house and in the attached four habitats, there are two additional Lion habitats to the east and one farther down the walkway which will be described at another kiosk.

It can almost be considered an incubator for new Lions. This protected environment allows Lions to get used to their new home as well as be introduced to one another safely and in a controlled manner. New Lions can be placed next to each other where they can get to know one another-- hopefully leading to the formation of new Lion prides or adding new Lions to an existing pride. Again, because the Lion House provides protection from the elements, it also allows newly-arrived Lions to acclimate to cooler weather if necessary.",

        "description": "Just like with arriving new Lions, the Lion House also provides a great place for geriatric or assisted living Lions. Sometimes, as an animal ages, it is no longer able to thrive in a large habitat due to the distances that need to be covered for feeding, watering and finding shelter. Often this is brought about due to arthritic conditions which are very common in captive-born animals. Just like an older person might prefer a studio apartment on one level rather than a 3,000 square-foot house on multiple levels, some older animals prefer and do better in a smaller area as they age. Again, because there are always Lions in the house or nearby, such animals receive the necessary social stimulation to be content and happy Lions. Not to mention, in the Lion House it is possible to provide incredibly warm and comfortable straw houses with heated flooring that provides comfort to older animals with arthritic joints and less body fat. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

On a rotating basis, one of these small cat groups is let into the central, larger area for a few days at a time. If you look down below by the water tanks, you will be able to tell whether or not the gate is open, allowing these cats access to the common space.

In answer to the most common question about the towers: no, the cats do not go all the way to the top. One volunteer has seen cats as high as the fifth level. However, the highest they are normally seen is three or four levels above the ground. Even if they came to the top they would not leap out of the enclosure or over to the walkway. Animals do not just blindly leap into open space. These tall towers are a very popular place for all of the migratory bald Eagles that spend the winter at the Sanctuary.

They are most often seen along big cat habitats sitting atop the fence posts waiting for their opportunity to drop into the habitat and eat leftover carnivore meat blocks.

If the Lions are not readily visible, keep in mind that they have both above and underground dens available. As mentioned previously, Lions are very territorial, so it is not uncommon to see this pride of Lions interacting with the pride of Lions just to the south of their habitat. Then, to the left or east is another pride of Lions including a white female who started life as a so-called pet in Mexico. The white coloration in Lions is related to albinism, whereas the white coloration in Tigers is not. You also may spot a white male with them, who was previously used for a hotel magic act in Guam, residing in a rooftop cage between performances.

        "description": "Hopefully by now you have noticed that the animals barely acknowledge your presence while up on the walkway. This would not be the case if you were at ground level with them. All of us know that wild animals typically try to remove themselves from the presence of human beings. They primarily do this by running away, but if that is not possible, they try to get the humans to run away by barking, snarling, growling, charging or the like. When running away is not possible and the humans do not leave, it creates a stressful situation that often causes neurotic behavior in the animal. Behavior such as excessive pacing, chewing on bars, self-mutilation and rocking and swaying are common. The Wild Animal Sanctuary only opened to the public once a way was found to prevent this stress. Almost by accident it was discovered that if you are above the animals they do not feel threatened in a territorial manner. It is much the same as human beings with birds and airplanes. Birds and airplanes fly above us all the time, yet we do not consider them a concern. This is also the reason why the Sanctuary does not allow ground-level viewing of the animals-- which would stress the animals out and eventually cause most of them to remain out of view when people are present.",

Amazingly, Sanctuary staff members have been able to build the entire structure on-site\u2014saving untold thousands of dollars. Arriving as raw, 3 inch steel beams, the steel is cut and fabricated into 40-foot long sections that are then placed in the habitats and connected together. Just ahead and to the left you will see a large and old crane situated between two Bear habitats. A relic of the past, it is a 1950\u2019s vintage crane built by the Koehring Corporation and was used in 2011 and 2012 to construct the mile-long walkway that stretched out to the Lion House. Using only cables and spools instead of hydraulics, it was a little tricky to operate, but it did a great job in hoisting the huge walkway sections into place. Unfortunately, it died where you see it, and because of its great bulk and weight has been difficult to move. We now see it as a connection to our past. And the birds like it too!",

During your visit today be on the lookout for all kinds of many smaller wild ecosystems. For example, the walkway itself provides nesting opportunities for birds in the springtime and early summer, while the ponds provide nesting areas for waterfowl. As one would expect, the ponds are full of water creatures including frogs, crayfish, turtles and even muskrats. The Sanctuary is also home to many wild Foxes and Coyotes, although they may not be as readily visible. And you should see numerous cotton-tail rabbits on the ground and even in the habitats where most of the time they are quite safe. Starlings by the tens of thousands are present year-round due to the abundance of extra food in the habitats, and surprisingly to many people, the Sanctuary also has thousands of gulls living here. Although a little bit messy, they are great janitors and clean up much of what the Bears don\u2019t eat. Many bird watchers love to come to the Sanctuary throughout the year to search for different species and to take wonderful photos of the birds that live and visit here. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

They were rescued along with 23 other Bears from the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio, Texas in the fall of 2010. This facility had hundreds of animals, many of which were rescued from laboratory situations. Sadly, the owner embezzled all of the money and then abandoned the organization. It was then taken over by the Texas state attorney\u2019s office who sought homes for the 300+ animals, including hundreds of primates. The Wild Animal Sanctuary agreed to take the 25 Bears. Tiny and Natasha are a delight to visitors because they are a bonded pair and are very often seen together interacting. Even though they have the nice waterfall feature, like children who\u2019d rather play with the box rather than the expensive toy, Tiny and Natasha are frequently seen playing in the smaller stock tank in the middle of their habitat. Tasha is known for chasing animal care vehicles up and down the fence line and she also likes to amuse herself by throwing sticks or other objects and then chasing after them.",

        "description": "Behind this Grizzly Bear habitat with the waterfall is another Bear habitat. It is one of only two habitats at the Sanctuary that has both Black and Grizzly Bears living together. The majority of Bears in this habitat are Black Bears that came from the Wild Animal Orphanage in San Antonio, Texas in 2010. The Sanctuary rescued a total of 25 Bears from that dire situation. Since then, additional Bears from other rescues have been added to this habitat. As mentioned, normally Black Bears and Grizzly Bears are not kept in the same habitat. However, the two older Grizzlies in this habitat were rescued along with the Black Bears and they have done well together. The main reason for not putting Black and Grizzly Bears together is that Grizzlies are typically larger and more intelligent, thus they can take advantage of that and can displace the Black Bears from food, dens and other choice locations.",

Sponsoring on behalf of a particular animal range from $20 per month for a small animal to $30 per month for a medium animal, and $40 per month for a large animal. Adopting either a medium or large animal also instantly qualifies a person to become an Active Supporter, in which case they are able to visit up to five times in a year and bring up to three guests each time at no cost.

Jacob was later introduced to Zola, a female Wolf rescued along with several other animals from the infamous Tiger King Park in Thackerville, Oklahoma. The two hit off immediately and are usually spotted in close proximity to each other. The habitat you are currently standing over, is home to a beautiful, female black wolf, named \u201cMoon.\u201d Her beginning in life was quite tragic as one of many wolves bred by a notorious exotic animal owner/breeder \u2013 also in Louisiana. The turning point in their story were the neighbors that called authorities after observing lifeless animals on the breeder\u2019s property. Moon was one of the lucky survivors and the Sanctuary was promptly called to rescue her as we had recently helped with Jacob just a year earlier. The locations of these wolf rescues merely a year apart, along with other factors, lead us to believe Jacob came from the same owner. We\u2019re so thankful for the concerned calls made by those neighbors and the tried-and-true adage: \u201cIf you see something, say something\u201d!",

This is the Carnivore Nutrition Center where, in the months when the Bears are awake, 100,000 pounds of food a week or so is processed. When the Bears are hibernating, that number drops to about 40,000 pounds of food a week for the carnivores. All of the food is currently donated from big-box stores located in the Denver metro area. The Sanctuary has three trucks and three drivers that go to over 60 stores each week up and down the front range of Colorado. This excess food, often having 2 or 3 days before expiring, is then brought to the Nutrition Center where our army of wonderful volunteers sort the food and prepare it into diets for the animals. The carnivores primarily eat meat blocks that are a combination of beef, poultry and pork to which eggs, vitamins, minerals and other supplements are added. The Bears eat primarily fruits and vegetables along with fresh fish, seafood, grains and some red meat. The Grizzly and Brown Bears eat a great deal more red meat than do the Black Bears. Typically, the carnivores are fed 3 to 4 times a week while the Bears have food in front of them all the time since they are foragers, just like humans.",

        "description": "If you look to the west you will see a modular home in which employees live. The lower level is the Sanctuary\u2019s well-equipped veterinary clinic. The animals that are rescued and live at the Sanctuary enjoy world-class veterinary care that is provided in many different ways. The Sanctuary has a full-time veterinarian and veterinary technician that work closely with the Animal Care staff and keepers. Most primary care is handled here on-site. The clinic is specially designed with a lifting system so that animals weighing hundreds of pounds can easily be moved around the clinic and into position for surgical procedures. The sanctuary also works very closely with the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Fort Collins. The teaching hospital is able to provide specialized doctors and care as well as provide CT imaging and MRIs when needed. Additionally, the Peter Emily International Veterinary Dental Foundation, located right here in Colorado, provides critical root canal therapy and other advanced dental care. Believe it or not, the number one health problem at the Sanctuary is simply old age and the chronic conditions that accompany it. As they age, many of the animals begin to suffer from osteoarthritis and other muscular-skeletal problems associated with their previous lives where they did not receive adequate nutrition, were perhaps declawed, and spent all of their time on hard, concrete surfaces. We are proud of the care we give each animal and know that it is only through the generosity of our supporters that allows us to continue such high quality care for the animals.",

Yes, the Sanctuary is primarily devoted to rescuing large carnivores, but sometimes other animals just need a home. For example, one of our rescued horses was part of a package deal when we rescued a Tiger from an elderly woman in Oregon. \u201cHow are we able to take in these other animals?\u201d one may ask. The Sanctuary does not extend its carnivore habitats up to the road but rather, leaves about a 200-foot buffer. This prevents people from doing dumb things along the road. As a result, there are many acres of pastureland available for our rescued hoof stock, and allows our making a good use of otherwise unused land. Many long-time supporters may recall the herd of Alpacas that was rescued in 2012 which now lives very happily at the Refuge. Visitors may also see Camels, Horses and even a couple of Mules that were faced with being euthanized when their entire substandard facility was completely shut down. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

The Sanctuary currently has over 200 Bears just at this location with many more down at the Refuge. Here guests can see what a typical Bear habitat consists of. All Bear habitats have many underground and above ground dens, water features and climbing structures. There are also two food stations in this habitat. Like people, Bears are foragers so food is basically kept in front of them at all times. This way the Bears can choose when to eat and what to eat. Bears are the easiest animals at the Sanctuary to put into large groups. At the end of the day, what is most important to Bears is simply food. As long as there is ample food to go around, Bears are not overly concerned with territory. One only has to think of a small salmon stream in Alaska that has multiple Bears fishing in it. Those animals would normally not be that close together, but since there is food enough to go around, all is well. Keep in mind that Black Bears vary greatly in coloration. They can range in coloration anywhere from blonde to black as well as red cinnamon coloring or even beautiful dark mahogany coloring.",

        "title": "Bear Hibernation",
        "description": "Almost without exception every Bear the Sanctuary has rescued has never had the opportunity to hibernate before arriving here. This is for a number of reasons. Often times they are not allowed to gain enough weight to go into hibernation or they are kept awake for performing or meeting the demands of tourists. Another reason is simply the lack of an adequate place or den in which to hibernate. However, living at the Sanctuary changes all of that. All of our Bears are given enough food to put on enough weight for Mother Nature to allow them to go into hibernation. Also, obviously, we are not asking anything of them and they have multiple den structures in which to hibernate. Every once in a while a new Bear may not hibernate their first winter here, but by the second winter they are usually more than ready to. Some of the Bears begin to den-up in mid-October while most of them do so throughout November. We typically figure that pretty much all of the Bears will be denned-up by Thanksgiving. At the other end of hibernation, some Bears begin to wake up in March while most do so in April. However, there are some late risers that will hibernate into the month of May. Usually by Mother\u2019s Day is when we figure all of the Bears will be awake for the summer. Contrary to what many may think, the Bears do not wake up very hungry. As their metabolism comes to life again, their appetite then begins to develop and grow as the summer passes. In looking behind the Black Bear habitat guests may see some rescued Camels. The Sanctuary has both Dromedary and Bactrian Camels. Dromedaries have one hump while Bactrians have two. They do very well in Colorado as they are very adaptable to both the heat and the cold. You may also see Camels in the large pasture to the south of the walkway depending on which area they have access to. One of our Camels, Morrison, is well known by guests as he has been here for over 15 years. Morrison was rescued from a horse stable west of here where he was raised with horses. As a result, he identifies more with horses than he does Camels. At first this may sound amusing, but in reality it is quite sad. Due to humans interfering with animals\u2019 lives, many do not even know what they are if they are not allowed to grow up around their own kind. Most of the other Camels were rescued from a roadside zoo in Virginia that was closed down due to multiple animal abuse charges, while one female Bactrian Camel was rescued from a hoarding situation here in Ordway, Colorado.",

This habitat shows the typical features found in Tiger habitats. These include plenty of dens, shade structures and water features. Tigers love water both in the summer and the winter, as they are known to break through ice to go swimming. Beyond this Tiger habitat is a Grizzly Bear habitat and another Black Bear habitat.

        "description": "Although they may be difficult to see, to the south and a little bit to the west where the second set of buildings is, the Sanctuary has a number of rescued potbelly Pigs, Kangaroos and Wallaroos. All of these animals came from a terrible hoarding situation in Ordway, Colorado in early 2019. At the time the Sanctuary was asked to assist with this dire situation, it was the only facility that could take all of the animals at one time. Also from this rescue, the Sanctuary took in a Camel, some Donkeys, Goats, Horses, Tortoises, Patagonian Cavies and various waterfowl. Many of the animals were rehomed to other sanctuaries that could provide a more suitable climate. One may be tempted to ask how the Kangaroos and Wallaroos do here in Colorado. Like all of our animals, they adapt by growing longer fur to keep them warm during the winter. But we also provide a heated, enclosed building for them for more extreme weather. If you take your time and patiently look, you may see some of the Kangaroos and Wallaroos hopping around their multi-acre enclosure. \u200bWhen the Sanctuary first moved to this location in 1994, there were almost no other people living in the area. It was literally an ocean of wheat fields. However, if you look around you will begin to see that more and more houses are being built in every direction. As you can imagine, land is essential to the operation of the Sanctuary-- both for the animals, of course, but also to provide a buffer from civilization. Since 1994, the Sanctuary has grown from 160 acres to its current size of 1,214 acres! Hoping to acquire additional land for these purposes, the Sanctuary approached neighbors in 2017. However, for a number of reasons, including the oil drilling boom in Weld County, surrounding land owners were not willing to sell their property even though they had previously given indications they would do so. As a result, the Sanctuary looked farther afield and in 2018, ended up acquiring a nearly 10,000-acre plot of land in southern Colorado \u2013 now called, \u201cThe Wild Animal Refuge\u201d! If you have interest in supporting that incredible facility by becoming a \u201cFounder\u201d, please seek more information at the check-in kiosks upon your return to the Welcome Center. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

That it is neutral is very important as it removes territoriality from the equation when Tigers are put together for the first time. And it is also used simply as a recreation area for Tigers living in the Roundhouse so they can have access to water, which they love, and at the same time, grow in confidence in their new and larger world.",

        "description": "The Sanctuary has had great success over the decades being able to form groups of Tigers that live together quite cohesively\u2014perhaps more like roommates than family members, but quite happily all the same. This is accomplished by observing individual Tigers very closely and looking for signs of compatibility and being very patient in allowing the Tigers the time needed to get to know one another in a non-threatening environment. Sometimes, this may take months or even years, but what\u2019s the hurry? Rushing the process will only ensure its failure. Of course, removing the competition around food, reproduction and territory is also key. Having enough room for multiple animals to live in the same space is absolutely essential, too. Most of us can relate to \u201cliving on top of one another\u201d and how it adds to stress and conflict. By having large areas in which the Tigers live, they can get away from one another if they are in a less-than-social mood. Here at the Tiger Roundhouse all of this takes place and is occurring even now. Yes, some of the Tigers you\u2019ll see in the Roundhouse are retired from habitats due to old-age issues, but just as many or more are taking the first steps towards living with other Tigers in their own large-acreage habitat.",

        "description": "The Tiger Roundhouse is where the majority of rescued Tigers begin their stay at The Wild Animal Sanctuary. Like the Lion House, this very controlled environment allows Tigers to be introduced to others while feeling safe and confident at the same time. Typically, two Tigers will be identified by the Animal Care staff that seem to have potential compatibility. At that point, the Tigers will be moved so they are next to one another in their enclosures. This allows the animals to get to know one another while feeling safe in their own space and with a barrier between them and the other Tiger. If it appears there is compatibility, the Tigers will be moved over by the Tiger Pool Area. At that point each Tiger will be allowed to go into the space individually so as to get comfortable within it. While doing this, they will also grow in confidence and their world will continue to open up and expand. Once each Tiger has had many opportunities to spend time in the pool area, the day will come when the two are introduced to one another in that space. This meeting will be closely supervised by Animal Care staff members. Because the Tigers already know one another, there is rarely ever any serious conflict. However, there may be some tension when they first have physical contact with one another, not unlike when two dogs first meet at a dog park. Usually after the initial greeting, the animals quickly begin to interact with one another and become friends. Once the Animal Care staff is certain that all of the initial tension has been dissipated, the Tigers will be allowed to live together here at the Roundhouse for a period of time before being moved out to a large acreage habitat.",

        "description": "As incredibly beautiful and majestic as the Sanctuary\u2019s Tigers are, they have no conservation value. That is, Tiger conservation organizations have no desire to use these animals for breeding purposes. The reason is, they are considered to be generic or mutt Tigers. In the decades that Tigers have been bred in captivity, especially those found in roadside zoos or private ownership, no regard has been given to maintaining genetic purity or specific subspecies of Tigers. Tigers have simply been bred with other Tigers leading to offspring that could genetically be any combination of subspecies. Since Bengal Tigers are the most common subspecies, the majority of rescued Tigers more than likely are predominantly Bengal, but could also have Siberian or Sumatran genes as well. The recessive gene that causes white Tigers is carried in Bengal Tigers so any white Tigers you see are most likely to be of that subspecies. Contrary to what many people believe, white Tigers and Siberian Tigers are not equivalent. Siberian or Amur Tigers, the largest cats in the world, have orange coloration. But no matter their genetic background, the Sanctuary believes these incredible animals deserve the best life possible after being treated so poorly by humans. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary.

The smaller enclosures are each animal\u2019s lair or \u201capartment\u201d, if you will. The Mountain Lions have access to the larger habitat next door which is discussed below. Even with the larger area, the Mountain Lions still spend time at their home base. Here there is a great sense of security and familiarity. Keep in mind that the Sanctuary always allows animals to make choices which gives them a greater sense of freedom that was so deprived of them in their previous lives. So even though we humans may think these look like small spaces, that is simply our projection, and not necessarily in accord with what is important and needed by each individual animal. Also living here, is a male, yellow-spotted Leopard, named \u201cKiro\u201d \u2013 who has indicated he prefers to live on his own, instead of with other leopards. Kiro has regular access to the adjacent five-acre habitat, as well, which he greatly enjoys exploring. This fellow was rescued from the illegal animal trade in Mexico and is a delight to behold\u2014if only you can spot him.",

The cats access this area via an enclosed alleyway system that you can see running along their enclosures. That alleyway leads to a passageway directly under the walkway that enters into the big area. Even when the Mountain Lions have access to the habitat, they can be very difficult to spot. They prefer not to be caught out in the open, so when moving around, they often do so in a quick and stealthy manner. Also, even when they do have access to the large area they like to spend quite a bit of time back at their home enclosure. Or they may make several trips throughout the day back and forth just to check on it. This habitat has many protected areas for these cautious cats. In addition to a number of underground dens, there is a half-buried sea-shipping container that has a southern exposure and areas inside it for the cats to rest and lounge about. Even though you may not see them, they are around and living a great life they could never imagine before.",

These habitats are inhabited by a variety of Tigers, Lions and big cat hybrids including Ligers and Ti-ligers. These animals were rescued from a facility called Wildlife in Need in Indiana in the fall of 2020. Breeding hybrid big cats is done for a couple of reasons. One is an attempt to avoid restrictions based on the Endangered Species Act and the other is simply for novelty. Sadly, as is always the case, the animals pay the price. Many hybrids suffer from significant health issues and do not live as long as a Tiger or Lion would. They also have difficulty fitting in socially because they are neither a Tiger nor a Lion. As always though, the Sanctuary will do everything within our power to give these animals the best life possible. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved.

Keep in mind that male Leopards live a solitary existence in the wild, so his living by himself is not a problem. Before his rescue, \u201cJumanji\u201d languished in an Ohio roadside zoo, where he was forced to endure freezing temperatures from lack of shelter, resulting in frost bite amongst other horrible health concerns.

There are many ways to help the animals. For a complete list you can visit our website, but some of the more common methods include adopting an animal or making a monthly pledge. Another option is to purchase items on the Sanctuary Wish List. Hopefully by now you realize that having large carnivores in a captive situation is rarely good for the animals. Another way to help such animals is to never, ever pay to play with, or interact with, exotic or wild animals. Unfortunately, social media and the selfie craze have increased the demand for such activities that are harmful to these creatures. The animals here at the Sanctuary are the lucky ones. Many others, sadly, get euthanized, are locked away once they are no longer useful, or are used for breeding and producing more cubs. Many animals, after they are no longer able to be handled as cubs, get sold to individuals who are in no position to properly care for them which leads to lives of extreme misery. Being aware of this and educating family and friends about it can save countless numbers of animals in the future from living in such horrible situations.",

Please consider this wonderful way to change the world for the better. \u00a9 2023 by The Wild Animal Sanctuary. All rights reserved. Terms of Use | Privacy Policy",
